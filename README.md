- 👋 Hey there! Carlos Casaleiro here, a coding enthusiast with a background in music and a passion for technology. Right now, i'm on a thrilling journey as a code cadet at Academia de Código.
- Born and raised in Espinho, a coastal pearl of Portugal, my path always revolved around music. But i have other plans for me now, and coding stole my heart.
- Now, I'm immersing myself in the world of programming, from conquering Java to tackling JavaScript, armed with music skills and good taste.🤟🏻
